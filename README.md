# Diaper-Bank-Data

Data+ Project: Visualizing Data to Increase Access to Diapers.
We created a dashboard to show our data visualizations and allow for experimentation with different filters. We used Python libraries, including Pandas, Dash by Plotly, and NumPy to create our dashboard and graphs. The dashboard will be implemented onto the National Diaper Bank Network website. 

The final dashboard code is in diaperdataC.py and diaperstyles.css files.
