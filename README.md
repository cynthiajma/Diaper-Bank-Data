# Diaper-Bank-Data

Project: Visualizing Data to Increase Access to Diapers.

This dashboard visualizes the data received from the National Diaper Bank Network's 2020 National Household Economic Survey with over 2.1 million data points. We created a dashboard to show our data visualizations for variables such as household income, average number of children in childcare, single head of household, and more. Our dashboard allows for the selection of various filters for state, race, and single head of household. 

We used Python libraries, including Pandas, Dash by Plotly, and NumPy to create our dashboard and graphs. The dashboard will soon be implemented onto the National Diaper Bank Network website: https://nationaldiaperbanknetwork.org/. 

The final dashboard code is in diaperdataC.py and diaperstyles.css files.
